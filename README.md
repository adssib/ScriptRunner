things to implement in the future

1.  adding parameters to the command itself to allow more capabilities and flexibilty

2.  do you want to retry if failed or not? as a parameter

3.  paralel processing? 

4.  more GUI like progress bar, do you want print the command you run or not? (echo on or off)

5.  colored output and a way to diffrentiate the commands of ScriptRunner.bat itself and the output of the other Batch files you feel me 

6.  Email notification ???!!!
